Trie Tree Implementation in Java
This project implements a Trie data structure in Java, which is a type of search tree used for efficient storage and retrieval of strings. The program includes a user-friendly menu system that allows users to insert, search, delete, and display words from the Trie.

Key Features:
Insertion of Words:

The Insert method allows adding words to the Trie, where each character of the word is stored as a node in the tree.
Search Functionality:

The Search method checks whether a given word exists in the Trie, making it efficient for string matching and retrieval.
Deletion of Words:

The Delete method removes a word from the Trie. If the word exists, it removes its nodes, otherwise, it returns a "Not Found" message.
Display of Words:

The output method returns all words currently stored in the Trie.
Menu System:
The project features a simple text-based menu with options to:

Insert strings into the Trie.
Search for a specific string.
Delete a string.
Display all words currently stored in the Trie.
Use Case:
This implementation is ideal for applications that require fast prefix-based searching, such as auto-complete systems, spell checkers, and search engines.
